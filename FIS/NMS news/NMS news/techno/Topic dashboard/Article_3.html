                Imagining what a home might look like can be tough for would-be buyers. However, a new tool from Redfin — powered by AI, of course — is designed to help.

Redfin Redesign, which launches today on listings from Redfin and Bright MLS, allows consumers to alter the appearance of walls, floors and countertops “in just a few clicks,” said Ariel Dos Santos, Redfin's senior vice president of product.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Buyers often want to know what a home will look like with some changes, not just what it looks like right now,” Dos Santos said. “Sellers want their listings to appeal to the broadest pool of buyers, regardless of design preferences.”

            <p>
                <b><em>How does it work?</em></b> <br><br>

                Redfin Redesign is powered by Roomvo, a home visualization platform. With the click of a button, home shoppers can select a listing photo, customize it by choosing from a range of flooring types, paint colors and countertop finishes, then compare before and after images.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b><em>Is it on all listings?</em></b>
                <br><br> So far, the tool is only available on active Redfin listings and eligible sold Redfin listings, as well as listings from Bright MLS, the nation's second-largest MLS covering the Mid-Atlantic region. That makes for a total of about 75,000 listings so far, but Redfin said it will look to grow that number through partnerships with other brokerages and MLSs.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Helping brokers deliver innovative experiences is something that's foundational to Bright as an organization. We are excited to be the first MLS to partner with Redfin to offer this tool that helps people reimagine home from their desktop or mobile device,” said Amit Kulkarni, Bright MLS's chief marketing officer.

                <em><b>What do consumers think?</b></em> 
                <br><br>Nothing is quite the same as seeing a home with your own eyes, but listings tech just keeps getting better — and people both appreciate and expect it. Redfin has offered 3D walkthroughs on listings for almost a decade, and Zillow continues to invest in multimedia as part of ShowingTime+, calling it “crucial” to selling a home.
