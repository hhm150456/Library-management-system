                    When it comes to female leadership and empowerment, modern-day icons like Malala, Hillary and even Beyoncé are quick to
                    come to mind. (Not to mention Emma Watson, Michelle Obama and "Lean In" coach Sheryl Sandberg.) Fortunately, there are a
                    lot more female leaders out there than common knowledge may suggest; from trailblazing politicians to dedicated
                    activists.

                <p><b>Chancellor of Germany</b></p>
                <p>
                    Merkel garnered the full spotlight when she was named TIME's
                    person of the year, but her notable acts go beyond gracing
                    a magazine cover. <br><br>

                    Despite strong opposition, she opened Germany's doors to migrants
                    during the Syrian refugee crisis.<br>

                <h1>Ellen Johnson Sirleaf</h1>
                <p><b>President of Liberia</b></p>
                <p>
                    Sirleaf is the first female president elected in Africa. She began her political
                    career in 1972, with a scathing message against the oppressive government
                    at her alma mater, then went on to work at the Treasury Department and later
                    became its Minister of Finance. <br><br>

                    Although she was put on a 30-year ban from politics, she ran for president but
                    lost to a political opponent accused of war crimes. She sent herself into exile
                    for her own safety soon after. <br>

                <p><b>State Counsellor of Myanmar</b></p>
                <p>
                    Suu Kyi took on the role of opposition leader against Burmese dictator
                    General Ne Win. <br><br>

                    Speaking out against him, she led a peaceful movement for democracy and
                    human rights. She worked to spread democracy throughout Myanmar and
                    founded the National League for Democracy. <br><br>

                    But in 1989, she was put on house arrest for 15 years to block her
                    from communicating with the outside world. <br>

                <p><b>President of Chile</b></p>
                <p>
                    Bachelet is the first woman to serve as Chile's commander-in-chief. <br><br>
                    Her calling to the political realm was an unfortunate one, since both she and
                    her father were tortured and exiled under Augusto Pinochet's dictatorial rule.<br><br>

                    Bachelet was sworn into her first term in 2006, and has been generally
                    well-praised, especially after her handling of the global economic crisis
                    in 2008. 

                    To top it off, she's also a pediatrician.<br>

                    (She succeeded Ben Bernanke in 2014.) She's a graduate of both Yale and Brown, and even President Obama has offered her his high praise. <br><br>
                    "She's a proven leader, and she's tough—not just because she's from Brooklyn," he said when he nominated her as Fed Chair in 2013.<br>
