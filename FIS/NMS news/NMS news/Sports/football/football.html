            <figcaption style="background-color : lightgray">Holders Manchester City go into the final round of the
                2023-24 group stage with a 100% winning record</figcaption>
            <p class="decoretion">This week will mark the end of the Champions League group stages as we know them.</p>
            <p class="decoretion">From next season the competition will adopt a Swiss league format, with all of the 36
                sides involved in one group and table.Each side will play eight games, instead of the current six, and
                there will be a new knockout play-off round introduced between the league stage and last 16.</p>
            <p class="decoretion">We've trawled through the archives and picked out some of the great group games from
                years gone by.Don't forget to rank yours at the bottom and ask your friends to do the same.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size : 28px">Galatasaray 3-3 Man Utd, 2023</h2>
            <img src="manu.webp" alt="this is pic" class="pic">
            <figcaption style="background-color : lightgray ">Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana made two costly
                mistakes in a 3-3 draw with Galatasaray in the Champions League group stage last month</figcaption>
            <p class="decoretion">
                Most great games have mistakes in, don't they?
                That was certainly the case in this game with Red Devils summer signing Andre Onana twice letting
                free-kicks in from Hakim Ziyech when he should have perhaps done better.
                United had raced into a two-goal lead, including a thunderbolt from Bruno Fernandes, but ended up having
                to settle for a point in a classic match they had led 3-1
            </p>
            <p class="decoretion">
                Manchester United blew a two-goal lead as their hopes of reaching the last 16 of the UEFA Champions
                League suffered a major blow following a pulsating 3-3 draw in hostile conditions away to Galatasaray.
            </p>
            <p class="decoretion">
                The Red Devils led 2-0 and 3-1 in Istanbul but once again failed to protect significant advantages in
                Europe this season to leave their hopes of progressing from Group A hanging by a thread.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 style="font-size : 28px">Marseille 1-2 Tottenham, 2022</h2>
            <img src="gettyimages.jpg" alt="this is pic" class="pic">
            <figcaption style="background-color :lightgray ">Tottenham's Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (right) celebrates
                scoring with Harry Kane against Marseille in the 2022 Champions League group stage</figcaption>

            <p class="decoretion">Tottenham are never far from drama in the Champions League.</p>

            <p class="decoretion">How about a 95th-minute winner to seal your place in the knockout stages?</p>

            <p class="decoretion">Spurs went behind against their French hosts and, if the scoreline had stayed that
                way, they were destined to drop to third in their group and as a consequence Europa League beckoned.</p>

            <p class="decoretion">But Clement Lenglet equalised and, with Marseille piling on the pressure as they
                needed to win to progress, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg struck a late winner to confirm Spurs as group winners.
            </p>

            <p class="decoretion">Spurs' position in the group had changed six times over the course of the match, and
                it was one of the great evenings of ebbs and flows.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 style="font-size : 28px">Tottenham 2-7 Bayern Munich, 2019</h2>
            <img src="gnabry2.jpg" alt="this is pic" class="pic" width="816">
            <figcaption style="background-color : lightgray ">Bayern Munich's Serge Gnabry celebrates scoring as Spurs'
                shipped seven goals in their 2019 Champions League group-stage encounter</figcaption>

            <p class="decoretion">It was a disastrous night for Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino as his side capitulated
                at home to the eventual German Bundesliga champions. He was sacked less than seven weeks later.</p>
            <p class="decoretion">Spurs actually took the lead through Son Heung-min, but Bayern scored five unanswered
                goals.</p>
            <p class="decoretion">Harry Kane scored from the penalty spot to reduce the arrears, but Serge Gnabry,
                formerly of Arsenal, then scored his third and fourth goals on an evening to savour for the visitors.
            </p>
            <p class="decoretion ">Tottenham Hotspur's troubles continued as they were humiliated in the most
                devastating fashion by Bayern Munich in the Champions League on one of the most embarrassing nights in
                their recent history as Serge Gnabry scored four goals.</p>
            <p class="decoretion "> The scale of this thrashing for manager Mauricio Pochettino and his players was made
                even more stark by the fact they took an early lead through Son Heung-min and were on level terms until
                just before half-time.
            </p>
            <p class="decoretion ">
                Bayern posed a huge threat throughout and were quickly on terms through Joshua Kimmich's superb 20-yard
                finish - but Spurs failed to heed the warning signs and ended up reduced to a rabble as they sunk
                without a fight in the second half.
                Strange as it may seem looking at the scoreline, this was an enthralling encounter that really turned on
                the stroke of half-time when, with matters in the balance, Robert Lewandowski produced a brilliant turn
                and right-foot finish past Hugo Lloris from 20 yards.
