                    <h1>The Little Mermaid, by Hans Christian Andersen</h1>
                    <pre>
    Ariel, the youngest of King Triton’s daughters, has wishes that will take her beyond 
    the ocean’s depths. 
    
    On one of the young mermaid’s trips to the shore, she encounters the dashing Prince 
    Eric and is instantly smitten. 

    The titular Little Mermaid decides to follow her heart and makes a deal with Ursula, 
    an evil sea witch, to grow legs and be able to experience life on land.

    Leaving behind all her fishy friends without properly reading the whole contract, 
    Ariel’s assimilation with humans proves more than troublesome.

        <h1>Tiny Beautiful Things, by Cheryl Strayed</h1>
        <pre>
        With Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern as executive producers, Tiny Beautiful 
        Things (previously adapted for the stage) will follow Clare as she navigates 
        marriage and motherhood while her once-promising writing careerslips like sand 
        through her fingers.

        An old writing pal asks Clare to take over as the advice columnist Dear Sugar 
        (Strayed’s real-life column) and a new chapter begins. 

        Finding her voice again through Sugar, Clare extracts the beauty in the struggle 
        of her readers and even herself.

        <h1>A Spy Among Friends: <br>Kim Philby and the Great Betrayal, by Ben Macintyre</h1>
        <pre>
        Kim Philby is a renowned spy and a fantastic liar. 

        He is so good at double-crossing that his best friend and fellow MI6 officer, Nich-
        olas Elliott, has no idea he’s working for the enemy.
        
        They’ve been friends and joined at the hip ever since school, so it seems 
        impossible that Kim could ever be a communist spy. 
        
        But not everything is how it seems.Against the backdrop of the Cold War, this tale 
        of unbelievable betrayal is at the heart of a complex web of conspiracy.
