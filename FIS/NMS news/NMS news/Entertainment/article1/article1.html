               <img src="everything_everywhere .jpg" alt="News Image" class="everthing">
                
                <p>“Everything Everywhere All at Once” dominated the Oscars on Sunday night, winning seven awards, including best picture,
                best actress, best director, best editing, best supporting actor, best supporting actress and best original screenplay.<br><br>
                
                “Everything Everywhere” had 11 nominations, heading into the night a big favorite.<br><br>
                
                Throughout awards season, the movie, a major touchstone for Asian representation in U.S. cinema, snared wins for acting,
                directing and best picture from various groups.<br><br>
                
                Directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert took home the directing prize. Michelle Yeoh won best actress, making her the
                first Asian star to take the award. Kwan and Scheinert won best original screenplay.<br><br>
                
                “Everything Everywhere All at Once” was not nominated for best actor, a category that for the first time since 1935
                features five actors who have never been nominated before. Brendan Fraser won for “The Whale.”<br><br>
                
                Ke Huy Quan won best supporting actor for his role in “Everything Everywhere,” and Jamie Lee Curtis, who’s been a film
                icon since the 1978 horror classic “Halloween,” scored an upset win.<br><br>
                
                This year’s ceremony marked the first time that four Asian actors competed across multiple acting categories.<br><br>
                
                Yeoh, 60, is the first Asian-identifying woman nominated for best actress. This distinction has been made because,
                technically, Merle Oberon, who was of mixed British and South Asian descent, was the first in 1935, earning a nomination
                for her work on the film “The Dark Angel,” but she concealed her heritage out of fear of discrimination in Hollywood at
                the time.<br><br>
                
                Ana De Armas was the first Cuban actress to be nominated for best actress, for her role as Marilyn Monroe in Netflix
                movie “Blonde.”<br><br>
                
                Angela Bassett also earned another first for the ceremony, becoming the first actor to receive a nomination for a role
                in a Marvel film. She was nominated for best supporting actress for her portrayal of Queen Ramonda in “Black Panther:
                Wakanda Forever.” The movie won for costume design.<br><br>
                
                “All Quiet on the Western Front” won four early on, mainly in the technical categories.<br><br>
                
                This year’s ceremony drew extra attention after Will Smith smacked Chris Rock during last year’s show. Host Jimmy Kimmel
                brought it up every chance he could Sunday night.<br><br></p>
