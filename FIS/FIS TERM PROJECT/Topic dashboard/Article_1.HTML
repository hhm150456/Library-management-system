                Steven Johnson has written 13 books, on topics ranging from a London
                cholera outbreak to the value of video <br> games. He's been a television
                presenter and a podcast host. He's a keynote speaker who doesn't
                have to call himself that in his LinkedIn profile. And for over a year 
                now, he's been a full-time employee of Google,<br> a status that's clear
                when he badges me into the search giant's Chelsea offices in New York 
                to show me<br> what his team has been creating.

                It's called NotebookLM, and the easiest way to think of it is as an AI collaborator with access to all<br>
                your materials that sits on your metaphorical shoulder to guide you through your project. <br>
                NotebookLM was soft-launched to a select group earlier this year but is now available to all as an <br>
                “experiment”—that's Google's low-risk way to see how the app behaves and how we behave with the app.

                Johnson found his way to Google by way of a lifelong obsession with <br>
                software as a “a dynamic thought partner,” a tool to speed up and <br>
                enhance the creative process. When he was in college he became obsessed <br>
                with HyperCard, Apple's software that broke knowledge into chunks and <br>
                allowed you to navigate an information-space through links. It <br>
                anticipated web navigation before the web existed. “I fought mightily to <br>
                 turn HyperCard into that dream tool, but it wasn't quite ready,” he says.<br>
                  He eventually became an enthusiast of Scrivener, a combination word <br>
                    processor and project organizer popular with book authors. (I am a fan too.)

            <p>
                When Johnson got access to OpenAI's GPT-3 text generator in 2021, he recognized<br>
                 that AI could level up a new generation of thought tools. Oh, wait, he said to <br>
                 himself, this thing that has always been in the back of my mind is now going to be<br>
                 possible. Scenarios unthinkable even a year before were suddenly on the<br>
                 table. Johnson didn't yet know that Google not only had similar large <br>
                 language models, but was already working on a project very much in line with his<br>
                 thinking. In May 2022, a small team in the experimental Google Labs division <br>
                 cold-emailed Johnson. They set up a meeting via Starline, a Google Labs project<br>
                 that allows for eerily intimate in-person meetings. “I basically had a conversation<br>
                 with a hologram who said, 'You know, this thing you've been chasing your whole life? <br>
                 We can finally build it,’” Johnson says. He became a part-time adviser to the small team,<br>
                 at first sharing the workflow of a professional writer. “Here's four or five engineers<br>
                 here's an actual author, let's just watch him,” is how Google Labs head Josh Woodward<br>
                 up the process. Eventually Johnson got involved in the development of the product<br>
                 itself and was sucked in to the point of accepting a full-time gig. His title at <br>
                 Google Labs is editorial director.
